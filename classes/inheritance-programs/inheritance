 NOTE

The class which inherits properties and methods is called the child class. And the class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the parent class. 
These names come from the nature that children inherit genes from their parents.


Example 1

class Person {
    constructor(private firstName: string, private lastName: string) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    getFullName(): string {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

    describe(): string {
        return `This is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    constructor(
        firstName: string,
        lastName: string,
        private job: string
    ) {
        super(firstName, lastName);
    }
}

const employee = new Employee('John', 'Doe', 'Front-end Developer');
console.log(employee);
