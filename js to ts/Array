 Calculate toal marks and percentage. (Input to be in array)

 let subject:number[]=[];
  let total:number=0;
  let n=Number(prompt("Please enter number of subjects:"));

for (let i:number=0;i<n;i++){
subject[i]=Number(prompt("Please enter number of subjects:"));
total += subject[i]
}
console.log(subject,total)
let per:number=total/subject.length;
console.log(per.toFixed(2)+"%")

if(total>=80)
{
    let result:string="pass"
    console.log("Hello, your grade is A  and your result is " + result + "! and your total is "+total);

}
else if(total <=79 && total >=40)
{
    let result:string="pass"
    console.log("Hello, your grade is B  and your result is " + result + "!and your total is "+total);

}

else if(total <=39 && total >=20){
    let result:string="pass"
    console.log("Hello, your grade is C  and your result is " + result + "!and your total is "+total);

}
else{
    let result:string="fail"
    console.log("Hello, your grade is D  and your result is " + result + "! and your total is "+total);

}
